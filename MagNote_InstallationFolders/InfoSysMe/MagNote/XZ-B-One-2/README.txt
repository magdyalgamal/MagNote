DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a full set of smart-looking animated cursors.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
These cursors are supported by the Windows-XP only, because they have
semi-transparent shadows. If you install them on earlier OS versions,
the shadows will be black and these cursors will not be usable.
To obtain cursor set without shadows, please refer to the URL:
"http://www.zerge.com/themes".

INSTALLATION
------------
To install this cursor set you should unzip the "xzbone.zip" file to a folder
on your hard disk and run the "incurso.exe".

DISTRIBUTION
------------
You may freely distribute packaged file "xzbone.zip" without changing or
renaming it. In other case the written permission from Xander Zerge is required.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
You may see flickering cursor image on slow machines. In that case, please
refer to the "http://www.zerge.com/themes" to obtain light version
of the cursor set.
